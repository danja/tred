# trev : triple editing and visualization

RDF in the browser, talking to a SPARQL store

_I had a quick stab at this in 2015 and then forgot about it. Now I want an RDF editor for [HKMS](https://hyperdata.it/blog/hyperdata-knowledge-management-system/) so reusing this repo_

## Status

**2021-12-08** lots of progress made, but still far from usable

_for detailed status see [devlog](https://github.com/danja/trev/blob/master/docs/devlog.md)_

**2021-11-05** : Revisiting, starting pretty much from scratch.

I'll put the work-in-progress live at https://hyperdata.it/trev
